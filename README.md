This is a cookiecutter reusable template and the steps bellow explain how to reuse this repository.

## Cookiecutter - create template for Python repository

1. In your project, in order to create templates, rename all your files/folders with the keyword 'cookiecutter' followed by the item name
    example: folder        -> {{cookiecutter.documents}}
             python file   -> {{cookiecutter.main}}.py
2. Add cookiecutter.json at the root of your project where you define the templates you created
3. Push the folder structure to your repo (Github, Azure Devops)

## Cookiecutter - reuse template from Github (windows)

1. On your local create a new folder where you will store the repository you want to clone.
2. Make sure your terminal is pointing to your new folder.
3. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv environment
4. Activate environment: .\environment\Scripts\activate
5. Install cookiecutter lib for pyton: pip install cookiecutter
6. Clone repo with cookiecutter: cookiecutter https://github.com/youruser/CookiecutterRepo.git (your github clone url)

## Other tips

1. When using step #6 from above, yout repo will be cloned in the .cookiecutter folder
2. For working with a specific branch you can just copy its content in the .cookiecutter folder and use that version for testing
